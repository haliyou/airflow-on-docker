--scalable:  Airflow has a modular architecture and uses a message queue to orchestrate an arbitrary number of workers. Airflow is ready to scale to infinit
--Dynamic: Airflow pipelines are defined in Python, allowing for dynamic pipeline generation. This allows for writing code that instantiates pipelines dynamically.
-- Extensible: Easily define your own operators and extend libraries to fit the level of abstraction that suits your environment.
-- Elegant: Airflow pipelines are lean and explicit. Parametrization is built into its core using the powerful Jinja templating engine.
